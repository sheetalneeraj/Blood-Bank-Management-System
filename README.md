# Blood-Bank-Management-System [DBMS Miniproject]

Blood bank management System is a  solution for all the Blood donation Problems.This system’s access is granted only to the Administrator and Users and it provides the users a very friendly user interface.
Admin’s functionalities are to view details, accepting/denying pending requests of a user who is registering, update mapping details and modify database.    
User’s functionalities are to register, view his donation details i.e., when and where he donated blood previously and also view his requesting details i.e., how much amount of blood of a blood group he requested previously. 
Users have to contact their allocated Blood Bank to donate blood or to have required amount of blood. The proposed system helps the management in searching blood in different areas. This system ensures maintainability. This System has scope to make changes easily, because it has been developed by using the feature of Modularity.
